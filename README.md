# Workouts_With_SQLite - android app
## Workouts lets users build their own workouts, set a timer for the workout and track their performance.  

The app has 3 main fragments â€“ MyWorkoutsFragment where users can find their workouts, CreateFragment where users can create a new workout, and ChartsFragment that displays saved data on the user performance (still in development).   
You can find them under: /app/src/main/java/com/workouts/workouts/  
  
In addition, there is also the PlayWorkout activity where the timer is implemented.

### SQLite  
The app uses SQLite databases for data storage, and implements the repository design pattern.
